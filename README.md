## Project description (max 0.5page)

The dataset we plan to use will consist of snippets from the script of the Vampire Diaries pilot.

The goal of this project is to see if we are able to then generate synthesized snippets of Vampire Diaries television script.

In part, we aim to demonstrate the actual feasibility, or lack thereof, of popular projects (and hoaxes) that people have published online in the vein of 'I forced a computer to watch 1000 hours of Seinfeld and made it write a new episode.'
