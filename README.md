## Project description

The dataset we plan to use will consist both of images of poison ivy and images of plants that look like poison ivy such as Virginia creeper, Boston ivy, boxelder, etc.

The goal of this project is to be able to input an image of a plant and classify whether or not it is of poison ivy. 

application of deep learning technique:
We will apply Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to facilitate categorization of these images. We plan on looking into examples such as MNIST and ImageNet to begin.

The application of this technology would be so that field workers can determine if a plant that looks like poison ivy actually poses a threat or not.
